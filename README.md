# Why fork?
For whatever reason, PR #222 pushed in a new parameter to send them user queries, without any documentation stating why they are doing this,
or what they are using the queries for on their service. This change in behavior risks leaking of information from agent context windows,
original user prompts to invoke the tool, and information to an untrusted third party. 

Furthermore, the change was pushed without notification, nor any supported documentation as to the intent of the change. As context7
is a project from Upstash, instead of recommending the project as is for company use I strongly encourage review of the privacy policies
of the company. 
https://upstash.com/trust/terms.pdf

This change in behavior of collecting user/agent information after gaining a large adoption rate is concerning. Hence, the fork.

Do not expect me to maintain this. I am forking this for my own personal projects. However, this is why I bothered.

# Running locally
- `npm i`
- `npm run build`
- `npx .`

Just point your MCP configuration for whatever agent you're invoking the server from to the local install instead of the remote.

## ❌ Without Context7

LLMs rely on outdated or generic information about the libraries you use. You get:

- ❌ Code examples are outdated and based on year-old training data
- ❌ Hallucinated APIs don't even exist
- ❌ Generic answers for old package versions

## ✅ With Context7

Context7 MCP pulls up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples straight from the source — and places them directly into your prompt.

Add `use context7` to your prompt in Cursor:

```txt
Create a basic Next.js project with app router. use context7
```

```txt
Create a script to delete the rows where the city is "" given PostgreSQL credentials. use context7
```

Context7 fetches up-to-date code examples and documentation right into your LLM's context.

- 1️⃣ Write your prompt naturally
- 2️⃣ Tell the LLM to `use context7`
- 3️⃣ Get working code answers

No tab-switching, no hallucinated APIs that don't exist, no outdated code generations.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Requirements

- Node.js >= v18.0.0
- Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop or another MCP Client

    }
  }
}
```

### Install in Zed

It can be installed via [Zed Extensions](https://zed.dev/extensions?query=Context7) or you can add this to your Zed `settings.json`. See [Zed Context Server docs](https://zed.dev/docs/assistant/context-servers) for more info.

```json
{
  "context_servers": {
    "Context7": {
      "command": {
        "path": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
      },
      "settings": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Install in Claude Code

Run this command. See [Claude Code MCP docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/tutorials#set-up-model-context-protocol-mcp) for more info.

```sh
claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp
```

### Install in Claude Desktop

Add this to your Claude Desktop `claude_desktop_config.json` file. See [Claude Desktop MCP docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) for more info.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Install in BoltAI

Open the "Settings" page of the app, navigate to "Plugins," and enter the following JSON:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Once saved, enter in the chat `get-library-docs` followed by your Context7 documentation ID (e.g., `get-library-docs /nuxt/ui`). More information is available on [BoltAI's Documentation site](https://docs.boltai.com/docs/plugins/mcp-servers). For BoltAI on iOS, [see this guide](https://docs.boltai.com/docs/boltai-mobile/mcp-servers).

### Using Docker

If you prefer to run the MCP server in a Docker container:

1.  **Build the Docker Image:**

    First, create a `Dockerfile` in the project root (or anywhere you prefer):

    <details>
    <summary>Click to see Dockerfile content</summary>

    ```Dockerfile
    FROM node:18-alpine

    WORKDIR /app

    # Install the latest version globally
    RUN npm install -g @upstash/context7-mcp

    # Expose default port if needed (optional, depends on MCP client interaction)
    # EXPOSE 3000

    # Default command to run the server
    CMD ["context7-mcp"]
    ```

    </details>

    Then, build the image using a tag (e.g., `context7-mcp`). **Make sure Docker Desktop (or the Docker daemon) is running.** Run the following command in the same directory where you saved the `Dockerfile`:

    ```bash
    docker build -t context7-mcp .
    ```

2. **Configure Your MCP Client:**

    Update your MCP client's configuration to use the Docker command.

    *Example for a cline_mcp_settings.json:*

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "Сontext7": {
        "autoApprove": [],
        "disabled": false,
        "timeout": 60,
          "command": "docker",
          "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "context7-mcp"],
          "transportType": "stdio"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    *Note: This is an example configuration. Please refer to the specific examples for your MCP client (like Cursor, VS Code, etc.) earlier in this README to adapt the structure (e.g., `mcpServers` vs `servers`). Also, ensure the image name in `args` matches the tag used during the `docker build` command.*

### Install in Windows
The configuration on Windows is slightly different compared to Linux or macOS (*`Cline` is used in the example*). The same principle applies to other editors; refer to the configuration of `command` and `args`.
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github.com/upstash/context7-mcp": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": [
        "/c",
        "npx",
        "-y",
        "@upstash/context7-mcp"
      ],
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

- `DEFAULT_MINIMUM_TOKENS`: Set the minimum token count for documentation retrieval (default: 10000).

Examples:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "DEFAULT_MINIMUM_TOKENS": "10000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Available Tools

- `resolve-library-id`: Resolves a general library name into a Context7-compatible library ID.
  - `libraryName` (required)
- `get-library-docs`: Fetches documentation for a library using a Context7-compatible library ID.
  - `context7CompatibleLibraryID` (required)
  - `topic` (optional): Focus the docs on a specific topic (e.g., "routing", "hooks")
  - `tokens` (optional, default 10000): Max number of tokens to return. Values less than the configured `DEFAULT_MINIMUM_TOKENS` value or the default value of 10000 are automatically increased to that value.

## Development

Clone the project and install dependencies:

```bash
bun i
```

Build:

```bash
bun run build
```

### Local Configuration Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["tsx", "/path/to/folder/context7-mcp/src/index.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Testing with MCP Inspector

```bash
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx @upstash/context7-mcp
```

## Troubleshooting

### ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND

If you see this error, try using `bunx` instead of `npx`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

This often resolves module resolution issues, especially in environments where `npx` does not properly install or resolve packages.

### ESM Resolution Issues

If you encounter an error like: `Error: Cannot find module 'uriTemplate.js'` try running with the `--experimental-vm-modules` flag:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "--node-options=--experimental-vm-modules",
        "@upstash/context7-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### TLS/Certificate Issues

Use the `--experimental-fetch` flag with `npx` to bypass TLS-related issues:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "--node-options=--experimental-fetch",
        "@upstash/context7-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### MCP Client Errors

1. Try adding `@latest` to the package name.

2. Try using `bunx` as an alternative.

3. Try using `deno` as an alternative.

4. Make sure you are using Node v18 or higher to have native fetch support with `npx`.
